# Firebrawn-unreal-4-shootthemup-unfinished-project-
A project I failed to make in unreal engine 4. I couldn't focus on the project. Figured someone else would like it.

I'm sorry about the tarball compression. You'll have to decompress the Config, Content, DerivedDataCache, and Intermediate folders. Before you start the project in UE4(Unreal engine 4)
